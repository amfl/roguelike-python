# More roguelike shenans

Just me messin' with roguelike stuff again.

Based on the [Roguelike Tutorial Revised][rtr], except when it's not.

I am targeting a terminal UI, so tcod rendering and input functions are not
used.

Project is for prototyping and fun only, so I am not too concerned with
addressing things like the docker image being 1GB+...

# Quickstart

```sh
./build-and-run.sh
```
